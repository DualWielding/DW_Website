1. TOC
{:toc}

In this article we'll present our very first game: Stellar Wrath.
We'll even offer you to download it at the bottom of the article.
But first, some context.

### 1GAM

1 Game A Month is a challenge game developers might decide to take up.
Once registered on the website, you have to create one game per month for a year.
A few weeks ago, we decided at Dual Wielding that we would take up on the 1GAM Challenge.

Why ? Since we already are in the process of creating our own indie game studio,
and therefore trying to create our first "big" game (we want to make micro-RPGs, so maybe not _that_ big...)
it might seem a bit ballsy to take up on the 1GAM.
Ballsy we are. But we also got good reasons. Here are the two main.

First of all, we want to build a community around us. The kind of community that will
grow with us and make our games better. And then buy our games. It's important.

But we want that community to be heterogeneous. We want passionate gamers (and game devs)
to follow us. But we also want people who think they are _not_ gamers to follow us.
That gamer's girlfriend who likes stories and enjoy discovering new ways of hearing them,
but hate having to dive into a pool of heavy game mechanics.
Or that married man, with a job, who used to love RPGs but can't spare a hundred hours to
play them anymore.

Second, we see the 1GAM Challenge as a huge laboratory. 
We will create very bad and (hopefully) very good games.
Then we will share them with everyone and hope they will give us feedbacks.
This will help us a lot when the time will come to release and advertise our first micro-RPG.
Also, we will improve a lot in our craft by making these 12 games. No doubt. And that's good.
 
So, 1st of October, we started creating our November game. Seems legit, right ?
Then the OpenJam came. We were waiting for the OpenJam to create our October game.

### OpenJam2017

The [OpenJam](https://itch.io/jam/open-jam-1) theme was _Leave a mark_, we had to use
at least 1 open-source tool and we had 72 hours.

Will this do ?

Since we are planning to use [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) as our main game engine,
the open-source limitation wasn't really an issue.
We also decided to pick all our arts on the internet. 
Creating a 100% open-source game we could be proud of.
Also, this was the cheapest option and we have no graphic-designer and no sound-designer.

### Stellar Wrath

We started the Jam with a brain-storm. We had 3 ideas.

First: a break-up simulator. The player would have been a girl trying to break-up with her boyfriend named Mark.
The idea was to have a dozen possible endings. We would have ended up creating
some sort of [Confess my Love](http://store.steampowered.com/app/637850/Confess_My_Love/) clone.


Second: a philosophy teacher simulator. The idea was to gather quotes from
peoples such as Kant, Nietzsche, Jaden Smith and Paris Hilton, mix them and
then make the player discriminate them under time pressure.
We didn't do it, but I bet it would have been pretty hard to find all these quotes.

Third: an angry asteroid, deep down in space, decides to blow his shitty solar system up.
A physics-based game, where everything explodes and nothing is left. Or what's left is in
a totally different condition.
I had some experience with the Godot physics engine and this option sounded fun, so that's the one we picked.

72 hours later, we submitted [Stellar Wrath](https://dualwielding.itch.io/stellar-wrath), then we took some sleep.
We'll follow up with blog posts about what we learned while making this game.
In the meantime, feel free to try it and give us feedback on itch.io, tweeter or by mail !
