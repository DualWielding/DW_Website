**Dual Wielding** is an independant video game studio. We should start as a real company around mid-2018.
We aim to create short and immersives RPG, based on high-quality narration and gameplay.

This project receives the help of the [PÃ©pite CREER](http://www.creer.lunam.fr/) (Nantes cente).

Don't hesitate to contact us if ever you feel that you should get in touch with us !
